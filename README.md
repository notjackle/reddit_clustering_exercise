# reddit_clustering_exercise
Extract insights from the social media content, based on a month of Reddit data. 

Address the following tasks:

*    A basic exploration of the data.
*    List of ideas that popped into your head during your exploration. Everything that you think is interesting to explore should be here.
*    Use topic clustering/modeling methods, in order to cluster Reddit’s/words. Then use these topics overtime to find interesting events in the data. In this part don’t use the “subreddit” column.
*    Evaluate Reddits topic clustering/modeling results using the “subreddit” column (as tagged data for Reddit’s topic).
*    Use methods for data cleaning.
